# Retail Trader Behavioral Modeling Template

This project provides a Python-based framework for modeling and visualizing short-term retail trader behavior around market events like earnings announcements.

It uses publicly available stock data to extract behavioral signals (like volume spikes and price reactions), combines them into a unified behavioral curve, and then models how this behavior evolves over time using machine learning and curve-fitting techniques.

## üîç What It Does

- Downloads stock data using a customizable ticker and date range.
- Calculates three key behavioral signals:
  - **Volume Pressure** (relative trading activity)
  - **Price Reaction** (daily price movements)
  - **Volatility** (short-term uncertainty)
- Combines them into a **Composite Behavioral Curve (CBC)**.
- Uses an **LSTM neural network** to forecast future behavior beyond the event window.
- Fits multiple candidate functions to the curve (e.g., damped oscillation, exponential decay).
- Shows the best-fit model and its statistical quality (MSE, R¬≤, confidence intervals).
- Plots the actual and fitted curves for visual analysis.

## üìå Why Use This?

If you're studying how traders behave during market shocks, this tool gives you a clean way to observe patterns, build models, and test hypotheses about behavioral cycles ‚Äî using just Python and public data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How To Use

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `behavioral_modeling_template.py`.
3. Replace the `TICKER`, `START_DATE`, and `END_DATE` values.
4. Run the script to generate your behavioral curve, LSTM forecast, and curve fits.
5. Analyze the output and visualize the results.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- `yfinance`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `scipy`

You can install them all at once:

```bash
pip install yfinance numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow scipy
